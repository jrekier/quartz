Ricardo.\n- Marx's contribution is the proposition that the value of a commodity is not simply equal to the labour time necessary to its production, but rather to the **socially necessary** labour time. \n- This observation has profound implications.

The difference is called **surplus value**.\n\n**Remarks:**\n- In order to repeat the cycle, capitalists must sell the commodity produced on the market. This process is called **realisation**. \n- As a buyer, the capitalist feels entitled to dispose of the labour power he acquired as he pleases. As the physical beholder of this power, the worker wants to retain as much as they can for themself. Both claims are equally valid in regards to the laws of exchange.\n\u003e Between equal rights, force decides.[^1] - [Capital, Vol. I, chap. 10](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm)\n- The opposition between the capitalist and the workers takes place **outside** of the sphere of exchange (the market), in [[The hidden abode of production]].\n\n[^1]: See an interesting recent restatement in the journal of the Belgian bourgeoisie: *\"Les juristes ont tendance √† tout vouloir consid√©rer comme du droit, or le conflit social est un conflit d‚Äôint√©r√™t, pas un conflit de droit.\"* [Dominique Liesse, \"Delhaize donne-t-il un coup de gr√¢ce au droit de gr√®ve?\", *l'√âcho*, April 2023](https://www.lecho.be/entreprises/grande-distribution/delhaize-donne-t-il-un-coup-de-grace-au-droit-de-greve/10461945)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-14T11:15:36.313854393Z","tags":["Economy","Marx/Capital"]},"/Permanent/Use-Value-and-Exchange-value":{"title":"Use Value and Exchange value","content":"\nCommodities have both **Use value** and **exchange value**. \n- **Use value** denotes the physical qualities of the commodity that makes it useful \n- **Exchange value** denotes the value at which it trades with other commodities.\n\n*Example:* \nThe use of a pair of shoes is to not get your feet wet when you walk around.
