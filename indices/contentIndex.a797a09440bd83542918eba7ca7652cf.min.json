Ricardo.\n- Marx's contribution is the proposition that the value of a commodity is not simply equal to the labour time necessary to its production, but rather to the **socially necessary** labour time. \n- This observation has profound implications.

The difference is called **surplus value**.\n\n**Remarks:**\n- In order to repeat the cycle, capitalists must sell the commodity produced on the market. This process is called **realisation**. \n- As a buyer, the capitalist feels entitled to dispose of the labour power he acquired as he pleases. As the physical propriator of this power, the worker wants to retain as much as they can for themself.
