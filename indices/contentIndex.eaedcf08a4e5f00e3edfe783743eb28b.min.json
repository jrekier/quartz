The symbol $\\exists$ stands for the english phrase \"there is\", or \"there exists\".[^2] \n\n$\\exists$ It is one of the two quantifiers. The other one is $\\forall$ which stands for \"for all\" or simply \"all\". \n\nPredicate allows to do **calculus** when we introduce logical connecters such as the *conditional*: $\\rightarrow$. \n\n**Usage:**\n\nIn predicate logic, the famous phrase \"Socrates is a man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal\", can be formalised as the following set of statements:\n$$\n\\exists s,Hs\n$$\nwhere $H$ is the predicate \"being a man\". The second part of the statement is:\n$$\n\\forall x, H x\\rightarrow Mx\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the predicate \"being mortal\". The full sentence is then:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\exists s,Hs\\\\\n\\frac{\\forall x, H x\\rightarrow Mx}{\\vdash Ms}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n**Remark:**\n\nIn the above, we cheated and used the symbol $s$ to simply *denote* \"Socrates\".
