## Observation: 
I see an animal moving after being immobile for a long time. 
- If I take equilibrium as a central concept, I wonder what set the animal in motion from its state of rest, and why did it happen now, and not at some other time. In other words:
	- rest is the norm, motion happens when rest is broken -> something must have broken the rest of the animal at a given instant
- If I believe that everything is in a state of unrest, then equilibrium is always temporary. In other words: 
	- motion is the norm, equilibrium is always transitory and imperfect -> the animal was never truly at rest, it just appeared so
## Lesson:
Depending on my philosophical inclination, the physical inquiry poses itself in very different terms.
