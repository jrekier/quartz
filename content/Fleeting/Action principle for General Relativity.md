The total action governing the motion of matter in (4d) space-time writes:
$$
S=\frac{1}{16\pi G_N}\int\sqrt{-g}\left(R+\mathcal{L}_M\right) ~d^4x~,
$$
where $G_N$ is Newton's gravitational constant, $g$ is the metric determinant, and $\mathcal{L}_M$ denotes the *Lagrangian* of matter. 

- The first part of this integral: $S_{EH}=\frac{1}{16\pi G_N}\int\sqrt{-g}R ~d^4x$ is the *Einstein-Hilbert* action.
- Variation of the action $S$ with respect to the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ gives the Einstein's field equation.
