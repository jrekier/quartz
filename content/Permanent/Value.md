Comes in addition to [[Permanent/Use value and Exchange value|Use value and Exchange value]]. Value denotes what *various commodities* with *equal exchange values* have in common. Namely that they are products of an equal amount of necessary human labour. 

In other words, exchange value is attached to a commodity, though it can be equal for various commodities. Value is *abstracted* from all commodities and denotes necessary labour time in the abstract sense (see [[Permanent/Labour theory of value|Labour theory of value]]).
