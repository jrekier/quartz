**Value** can only be created by human labour -> machines do not *create* value. Machines *have* value and *transfer* some of it to the product.  

**Remarks:**
- This was the received view in Marx's time, adopted by the likes of A. Smith and D. Ricardo.
- Marx's contribution is the proposition that the value of a commodity is not simply equal to the labour time necessary to its production, but rather to the **socially necessary** labour time. 
- This observation has profound implications. One of which being that the value of commodities decreases as the productivity of labour increases.
