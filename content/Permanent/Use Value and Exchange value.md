Commodities have both **Use value** and **Exchange value**. 
- **Use value** denotes the physical qualities of the commodity that makes it useful 
- **Exchange value** denotes the value at which it trades with other commodities.

*Example:* 
The use of a pair of shoes is to not get your feet wet. It can be traded against one coat (say). 

**[[Permanent/Value]]:**
In that example, the pair of shoes and the coat have equal exchange values which cannot derive from any physical properties of shoes and coats. They have in common of being *products of labor*, and as such, their respective exchange values is equal to a third thing, namely *the labor time socially necessary to their production* (see [[Permanent/Labour theory of value]]).
