In order for a capitalist to make a profit, the [[Permanent/Value|Value]] added to the product by the labourer *must be superior to the value paid by the capitalist as wage*.

Therefore **[[Permanent/Labour and Labour Power]]** must be different: capitalists pay the value of the latter, and appropriate the product of the former as commodity. The difference is called **surplus value**.

**Remarks:**
- In order to repeat the cycle, capitalists must sell the commodity produced on the market. This process is called **realisation**. 
- As a buyer, the capitalist feels entitled to dispose of the labour power he acquired as he pleases. As the physical propriator of this power, the worker wants to retain as much as they can for themself. Both claims are equally valid in regards to the laws of exchange.
> Between equal rights, force decides.[^1] - [Capital, Vol. I, chap. 10](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm)
- The opposition between the capitalist and the workers takes place **outside** of the sphere of exchange (the market), in [[The hidden abode of production]].
