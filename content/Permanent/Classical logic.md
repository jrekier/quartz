Its invention is attributed to Aristotle. Its content was given a mathematical form in the early 20th century, by [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege) and later [Bertand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell). 

Its three defining axioms are (aka. the [law(s) of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought)):
1. $\forall p, p= p$ (identity)
2. $\lnot(p\land\lnot p)$ (no-contradiction)
3. $(p\lor \lnot p)$ (excluded middle)

This formulation is not given by Aristotle. It was developed later by Hamilton, Boole, Schopenhauer, etc. 

## Remarks
- In [Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica) the above three rules are presented as theorems and not axioms
- The principle of identity is a bit special as it involves a *quantifier* (see [[Permanent/Predicate logic]])
